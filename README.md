UI Part:-
1.	There are 2 Activity, On 1st Activity there is only one Button, when we click on this button, 2nd Activity will open, where we can see Last 5 days weather details in list.
2.	In weather details, I am showing only three things, 1. Main 2. Description 3. Date time
3.	I am displaying these data main, description and date time from list json array.


Coding Part:-
1.	There are 2 Activity, one is MainActivity and second is LastFiveDaysWeatherActivity.
2.	In MainActivity, there is only one Button to open second LastFiveDaysWeatherActivity.
3.	LastFiveDaysWeatherActivity is using for displaying the weather derails in list.
